\section{Basic homomorphic encryption based key exchange}
	In this section we review the basic key exchange based on homomorphic encryption and detect it's vulnerability. \\
	Suggested algorithm is an analogue of 
	Let's suppose, two users -- Alice and Bob have vectors $ \textbf{x}, \textbf{y} \in \mathbb{Z}^k $
