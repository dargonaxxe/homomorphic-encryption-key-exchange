\section{Conclusion}
	The reviewed algorithm is a promising cryptographic primitive that is believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. The implementation results are presented in Table 1. The benchmarking results are measured on Intel Core i7-640M with 2 cores running at 2.8 GHz. The implementation details are shown in GitHub repository\footnote{\href{https://github.com/dargonaxxe/homomorphic-encryption-key-exchange}{github.com/dargonaxxe/homomorphic-encryption-key-exchange}}
